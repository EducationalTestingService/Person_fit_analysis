R code to accompany an article published in Applied Measurement in Education (Sinharay, 2017)
The R code provided here computes the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for each of the 60 simulation cases considered in Sinharay (2017), then computes the overall AUROC using the Dersimonian-Laird algorithm (that is the more rigorous approach) and using the approach used in Karabatsos (2003), which is an inappropriate approach. The code also computes the AUROC for each of the three test lengths using the approach suggested in Sinharay (2017). Comment lines are provided for the convenience of the readers.
